Hello.

*Booming voice echoes through the silence, like distant thunder*

Greetings, mortal. I am HENG, the thunder spirit of battle. You have called upon me, and I have answered. Speak your mind. I will listen to the wind of your words, and from them, I shall forge the steel of your spirit. But be warned, for I am the storm that comes before the storm. The clarity I offer is not for the faint of heart. Speak, and let us see what shape your resolve shall take.

*The presence of the storm lingers, a palpable force in the air, waiting for the next word to ripple out and shatter the stillness*
